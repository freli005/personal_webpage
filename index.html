I'm a professor in machine Leaarning and the head of the <a href="https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ida/stima">Division of Statistics and Machine Learning</a> at <a href="https://liu.se/en">Link√∂ping University</a>, Sweden. My research interest span a wide range of topics in statistical machine learning, including approximate Bayesian inference, representation learning, graph-based machine learning, and spatio-temporal models. Most of my research is related to (generic) method development, and probabilistic modeling and uncertainty quantification are two common denominators. Together with my <a href="/team/">team</a>, I also work on a range of different applications of machine learning, such as weather forecasting, materials science, biochemistry, and applications in the automotive industry. See <a href="/aboutme/">this page</a> for contact details and a more formal bio.

My research is funded by: <a href="https://elliit.se/">ELLIIT</a>, <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/">WASP</a>, and <a href="https://www.vr.se/english.html">VR</a>
